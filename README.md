A growing collection of scripts to perform various cleaning, organization and maintenance tasks in my homelab and help me get better at writing Python.

CONTENTS: 

organize_downloads: A simple script that sorts the contents of my downloads folder by file type to make it more manageable
remove_zips: A script to recursively delete all .zip files in the selected directory and all subdirectories.

More to come...
